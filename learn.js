//JAVASCRIPT: SCOPING
//Hoisting- Javascripts default behaviour where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope,just before execution.
//We can therefore call/invoke functions before even writing/creating them.
//Hoisting only moves declarations, initializations or assignments are left in place.

hello();

function hello(){
    console.log("hello")
}
///declaration
let game100;
console.log(game100);
//initialisation
game100= "SpiderMan";
console.log(game);
