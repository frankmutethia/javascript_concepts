//JAVASCRIPT: ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
// Assigment Operand - gives value to the left-side operand depending on the value of the right-side operand. 
//Assignment operators assign value to JavaScript variables.Examples:

let grade = 700;
grade = grade + 77;
console.log(grade);

//+= assignment operator
let price = 50000;
price += 500;
console.log(price);

//-= assignment operator
let tagPrice = 50000;
tagPrice -= 500;
console.log(tagPrice);

//*= assignment operator
let peaches = 500;
peaches *= 5;
console.log(peaches);

//  / assignment operator
let pie = 70;
pie /= 4;
console.log(pie);

//modulus assignment operator
let cake = 77;
cake %= 3;
console.log(cake);
