//JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES
//In JavaScript values are always of a certain type and these types are referred to as data types.
//The data types are categorized as primitives and non-primitives.
//Primitive data types- can hold only one data value.They include: numbers, string, boolean,bigint, symbol, undefined and null.
//Non-primitive- can hold multiple data values.They include object(arrays, functions and objects). Stores complex and numerous values.

//Primitive Data Types
//Numbers- mainly contains numerical values.e.g. let num = 7;
//Strings- contains a series of characters.e.g. let favMovie = "Avengers: Infinity War";
//Booleans - they compare and assess certain values. Outputting only false or true values. e.g. console.log(5> 100);
//Bigint- it is used to handle huge amounts of data.e.g.

let bigNumber = 7700021000003250000n;
console.log(typeof bigNumber);

let myList=["Paprika", "Curry Powder", "Red Pepper"]
console.log(myList[2]);

// In JS:
// = used to assign value.
// == used to compare two values to see if they are equal.

let powerCode =7.89;
console.log(typeof powerCode);
