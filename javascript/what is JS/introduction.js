//JavaScript is an object based scripting language, that is used to make websites dynamic and interactive.
//Some of the practical uses of JavaScript include:
//1. Building of mobile apps.
//2. Interactive maps.
//3. VR.
//4. Booking systems.
//5. Games.
//6. Animations.
//7. Data visualization.


 //ADDING JS TO YOUR PROJECT:
//Through the script tag and files.
//The script tag should be added after the closing body tag.
//Block and inline elements.


// JAVASCRIPT : ASYNC AND DEFER
//Async- allows your script to run as soon as it is loaded, without blocking other elements on that page.
//Defer- means that your script will be executed after the page finishes loading.
