//JAVASCRIPT LOGICAL OPERATORS:
//Logical Operator - symbol used to connect two or more expressions,such that the compound expression produced depends on the original expression.
//JS 'Falsy' values- undefined, Nan, 0, false, null and empty string.
//False - an empty string.
//Undefined- Nan
//The null value is given to '0'.
// (?)- this is the Nullish Coalescing
//When we negate true we get false. Then, false we get true.
let h= 1;
h =!h;
console.log(typeof h,h);

let f = 0;
f = !f;
console.log(typeof f,f);

//true and false = false
//true or false = true
